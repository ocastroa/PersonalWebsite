                My love for coding began after I developed and published my first Android app, Big O. While the app was not super complicated, it taught me a lot about mobile development and it grew my interest for coding. After graduating UC Santa Cruz with a B.S. in Computer Science, I landed an internship at PubNub as a Developer Relations Engineer. I learned a lot in my internship, from learning new frameworks such as React/React Native to learning how to network with other Engineers at Meetups. In four months, I strengthen my technical skills in web and mobile development, as well as improve my technical writing skills. 
                             
            <p class="lead">Besides working on projects, I like to workout, read, listen to music, and binge watch shows.
